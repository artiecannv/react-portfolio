# React Portfolio

## Description

Utilizing the new skills I have been building on within the past 24 weeks, I have refactored the Portfolio I made during the second week of the bootcamp. I have learned a ton throughout the course, especially when my two portfolios are compared. This application includes a blurb about me, a contact form, my portfolio of projects, and my resume.
